This is an application, I developed as part of my university work. The app itself takes in data from the FastF1 API, processes it and then stores the data into a MongoDB database. The data is then used to create visualisations for the user based on their inputs.
examples of the visualisations include; position changes for drivers during an F1 race, Tyre compounds used by each driver during the race, a heatmap of the track showing an individual drivers speed.
This work awarded me an A+ for the assignment of creating a data visualisation app that collects data from a live API.
